# Check valve bonnet is a self energized gaskets - Per appendix H = FKM (Viton) seal
# Self‐energizing gaskets may be considered to require an inconsequential amount of bolting force to produce
# a seal. Bolting, however, must be pretightened to provide a bolt load sufficient to withstand the hydrostatic end force H.

d = 3.75 # diameter, or short span, measured as indicated in Figure UG-34
C = 0.3 # a factor depending upon the method of attachment of head, shell dimensions, and other items as listed in (d) below, dimensionless

S = 20000 # maximum allowable stress value in tension from applicable table of stress values referenced by UG-23
E = 1.0 # joint efficiency, from Table UW-12, of any Category A weld as defined in UW-3(a)
Wb313 = 1.0 # ASME B31.3 weld joint strength reduction factor per para. 302.3.5(e)]
Sf = S*E*Wb313 # B31.3 adaptation = product SEW [of the stress value, S; the appropriate quality factor, E, from Table A-1A or Table A-1B; and weld joint strength reduction factor per para. 302.3.5(e)]
